# Algorithms and Data Structures

Implementation of various algorithms and data structures. You can find more information about each of them further below.

**Note**: the goal of this project is not to demonstrate how to write high-quality object-oriented code. Instead, focus is on implementing and demonstrating usage of various algorithms and data structures, while keeping the code as simple as possible.
